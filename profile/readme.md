# WolfieEngine
Welcome to the WolfieEngine organization! 

### About
The WolfieEngine organization is an organization based on the Wolfie2D game engine. Wolfie2D is a game engine written in Typescript for developing web-based games. Joe Weaver and Professor Richard McKenna founded Wolfie2D in Fall 2020 for Stony Brooks 2D game programming course as an alternative to Phaser. 

The problem with modern game engines like Phaser is that they are, for lack of a better word, extremely complicated. Most game engines provide high-level tools that make dealing with this complexity more manageable. For professional game developers, these abstractions allow them to be more productive, but for students, these high-level tools tend to impede the learning process. In other words, students can’t learn about game engines by treating them as black boxes. What we want for a course like CSE-380 is a game engine that provides little to no abstraction of the engine’s core systems. 

Finding such a specific game engine is next to impossible, which is why we created Wolfie2D.
