### About
The WolfieEngine organization is an organization based off the Wolfie2D game engine. Wolfie2D is a game engine written in Typescript for developing web-based games. Wolfie2D was founded by Joe Weaver and Professor Richard McKenna in Fall 2020. Wolfie2D was specifically made for use in Stony Brooks 2D game programming course as an alternative to Phaser. 

The problem with modern game engines like Phaser is that they are, for lack of a better word, extremely complicated. Most game engines provide high-level tools that make dealing with this complexity more manageable. For professional game developers, these abstractions allow them to be more productive, but for students, these high-level tools tend to impede the learning process. Students can’t learn about game engines by treating them as black boxes. What we want for a course like CSE-380 is a game engine that provides little to no abstraction of the engine’s core systems. 

Finding such a specific game engine is next to impossible, which is why Wolfie2D was created.
