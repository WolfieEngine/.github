## Teams
Right now, we are in the process of setting up the various subteams for the WolfieEngine project. The current teams have been outlined below. If you'd like to join one of the teams, please fill out the form linked [here](TBD).

### Feature Development üöß
#### Prerequisates: CSE-380; CSE-316 or equivalent
The feature development team is responsible for developing, testing, and maintaing the core subsystems of the Wolfie2D game engine. If you're on this team, you'd better know what you're doing. Some current features we are working on include the following:
- Adding a playback system that allows games to be recorded and replayed.
- Adding support for isometric tilemaps.
- Adding an implementation of A* for pathfinding.

### Testing üîé
#### Prerequisates: CSE-216, CSE-260 or equivalent
The Wolfie2D game engine is built on top of a suite of custom data structures and algorithms. The testing team is responsible for building out our the testing library for Wolfie2D. You should have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. You should also be comfortable dealing with math-heavy code. Some example algorithms and data structures you'll be working with are outlined below:
- Pathfinding Algorithms (A*)
- Collision Detection Algorithms (SAT)
- Mapping between coordinate systems
- QuadTrees
- Custom lists, stacks, and queues

### Documentation ‚úçÔ∏è
#### Prequisates: CSE-380
Our goal over the next year is to improve the documentation for Wolfie2D, primarily by adding hard examples and demo games to the engine that demonstrate how to use the various features of the engine, and how to use them *properly*. You should have past experience making games with Wolfie2D. Past experience writing professional documentation is also a plus. 


## Fixing a Bug
* First, check to see that there is not an open issue regarding the bug already.
* If there are no open issues regarding the bug, create a new issue from the bug report template. When you file the issue, please include
  1. A title and clear description of the bug
  2. The expected behavior or output
  3. A set of steps to reproduce the bug
  4. Any relevant code samples or screenshots that demonstrate the issue.

## Feature Requests
If you have an idea for a feature, first check to see that somebody else hasn't created a feature request for your feature already. If there are no open feature requests similar to your feature, create a new feature request issue from the feature request template.

## Questions
First, check to see if somebody else hasn't already asked your question. If there are no open or closed issues that answer your question, create a new issue from the question template.
